# Assessing EU Performance Toward Fit for 55: A Predictive Time Series Approach

### The Project

This study assesses the progress of the ten most economically significant EU member states, as well as the EU as a whole, towards meeting the “Fit for 55” package's intermediate target of reducing CO₂ emissions by 55% by 2030 compared to 1990 levels. A hybrid predictive approach combining supervised and unsupervised methods was applied to generate country-level forecasts using the best-performing ETS and ARIMA models with optimized parameters.
